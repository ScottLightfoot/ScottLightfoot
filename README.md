      <p>In 2005 I received a BFA in Broadcasting and Cinematic Arts, which inevitably led me to an array of careers over the 15 years that followed. Despite some levels of success, at no point did I settle into a long-term career within those disciplines. All the while, my eagerness to create solutions to workplace bottlenecks left those workplaces in better states than when I had arrived.  I endeavor to have that reputation wherever my work may lead!</p>
